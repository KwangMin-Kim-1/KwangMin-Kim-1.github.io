Hello! I am currently working as a Senior Research Engineer at Manufacturing Robot Team in Samsung Electronics. I received my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Prof. [Dongjun Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qKexATgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Interactive & Networked Robotics Laboratory (INRoL)](https://www.inrol.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University (SNU). Before then, I obtained my bachelor's degree from SNU.

My research interests lie across **robot learning, control theory, and optimization**.
* My current research at Samsung Electronics is centered on **robot learning** of contact-rich **bimanual manipulation** tasks in unsructured environments focusing on manufacturing robots.
* At Samsung Electronics, my research was also centered on **optimization-based motion planning and control** for the applications of **legged locomotion** and **autonomous driving**.
* My Ph.D. research at SNU was centered on optimization-based/optimal/nonlinear **control theory** and probabilistically optimal nonlinear state **estimation theory** with applications to automation of complex mechanical systems.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
